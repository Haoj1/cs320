# Lab 10

Activities:

1. Share with your group: *what is the best piece of advice you've ever been given?*

2. Practice [regular expressions](./regex-smiles)

3. Debugging Practice: inside your `s22` repo, there is a `labs/debug/7-nested-except/divide.py`.  Try running it from the terminal, then fix the bugs.
