# Lab 12

Activities:

1. Share with your group, *what is something about the world you wish you could predict?*  It could be about the future, or some other unknown.  Discuss whether this would be a regression problem or a classification problem.

2. Debugging Practice: inside your `s22` repo, there is a `labs/debug/8-geo/main.ipynb`.  Try to fix the bugs.  There is a `solution.ipynb` too, but only peek as a last resort!

3. Use a LinearRegression to [predict how long](./regression) it will take to run a piece of code
