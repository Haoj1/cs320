# Lab 9

Activities:

1. Share with your group: *what was the highlight of your spring break?*

2. Debugging Practice: inside your `s22` repo, there is a `labs/debug/6-flask/main.py` and accompanying `index.html` file.  Try running it, then fix the bugs.  These are bugs we often see in P4, so this will help you avoid (or fix) bugs as you're working on the project.

3. Create a [Guess that Function](./flask-guess) game in Flask

4. Consider starting the group portion of P4 with your group during the remaining lab time
