path: sequence of edges (non repeating) between two nodes
connected: there's a way to get from any node to any other node
Directed: edges have arrows/direction
DAG: directed, acyclic, graph
Acyclic: no paths from a node back to itself
Strongly connected (connected): there's a way to get from any node to any other node
Weakly connected: there's a way to get from any node to any other node if I'm willing to "drive the wrong direction" along an edge
Parent: source of an outgoing edge
Child: destination of an incoming edge
Root: any node with no parents
Leaf: any node with no children
Tree: a DAG such that every node only has one parent, except the root which has zero
Binary Tree: is a tree such that a parent has AT MOST 2 children
